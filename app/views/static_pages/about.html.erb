  <h2 class="center_title">Who Am I?</h2>
  <div class="center_tight">
    <p>Great question! Currently I am in the midst of a career change. Recently I graduated from Dev Bootcamp's web developer immersion program, and am currently seeking employment as a software engineer.  For the previous 13 years I worked for my local church in various capacities, and am still active in the church as a volunteer assistant pastor.</p>
    <p>My passions are seemingly disparate: mentoring men &amp; youth, solving complex problems and logic puzzles, restoring relationships, and generating &amp; reveling in absurd humor. Ultimately, I enjoy guiding people into their destinies, and I enjoy life. Hopefully we can make some tools to help more people do the same.</p>
    <p>How does this all connect to my new career path? Simply put, as a software engineer my personal career goal is to build tools that make peopleâ€™s lives better, by utilizing technology to further meet the felt needs of those less well-off than me in this world.</p>
    <p>My strongest skills are analytical thinking, relationship building and reconciliation, and making people laugh. I also like to finish what I have started.</p>
